You offered him to build class that could be <strong>inherited</strong>, and could provide some class method to modify name of already existing classes. The new class should be named as</p><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="cm-variable">ReNameAbleClass</span></code></pre><p>and the special one method should be </p><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="cm-variable">change_class_name</span></code></pre><p>Like before, be sure that new solution will allow only names with alphanumeric chars (upper &amp; lower letters plus digits), but starting only with upper case letter. </p><p>Moreover, for testing purposes, he want new class to have </p><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="cm-variable">__str__</span></code></pre><p>method which will be returning string like "Class name is: MyClass" for MyClass.</p><p><br><br><strong>Too easy?
